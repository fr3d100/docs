## Welcome
BetterContact API documentation is easy to use. It exists a first endpoint to submit one lead or a batch of leads to enriche and a second enpoint to fetch the results.

<Note>
  You can also set up a webhook url in the first API call and the results will be directly pushed to this url once done. No need to fetch the results asynchronously.
</Note>



## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using the parameter _api_key_ to provide in the request.

This API key can be found [here](https://app.bettercontact.rocks/api) in your BetterContact account.
