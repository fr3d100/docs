## Welcome

BetterContact API documentation is easy to use. There exists a first endpoint to submit one lead or a batch of leads to enrich, and a second endpoint to fetch the results.

<Note>
  You can also set up a webhook URL in the first API call, and the results will be directly pushed to this URL once done—no need to fetch the results asynchronously.
</Note>

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using the X-API-Key header parameter, **which** must be provided in the request.

<Note>
  This API key can be found [here](https://app.bettercontact.rocks/api) in your BetterContact account.
