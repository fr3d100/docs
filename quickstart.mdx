## Purpose

BetterContact API purpose is to be the only API you need to integrate for your leads and contact enrichment. No more need to create in-house waterfall enrichment process with dozens of API calls to several providers.

### How it works

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="upload" title="Submit your lead(s) to enrich">
    BetterContact API have a signle endpoint to enrich a single lead or a batch up to 100 contacts at a time.
    [See endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/create)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="download" title="Fetch results">
    Previewing helps you make sure your changes look as intended. We built a
    command line interface to render these changes locally. 1. Install the
    [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the
    documentation changes locally with this command: ``` npm i -g mintlify ```
    2. Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where
    `mint.json` is): ``` mintlify dev ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Install our Github app">
  Our Github app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you
  don't need to manage deployments yourself. You can find the link to install on
  your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Once the bot has been
  successfully installed, there should be a check mark next to the commit hash
  of the repo.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push your changes">
  [Commit and push your changes to
  Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push)
  for your changes to update in your docs site. If you push and don't see that
  the Github app successfully deployed your changes, you can also manually
  update your docs through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
</Accordion>
