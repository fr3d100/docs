### Purpose

BetterContact API’s purpose is to serve as the only API you need for your contact data enrichment. No need to create an in-house waterfall enrichment process with several API calls to different providers.

### What BetterContact does

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="1" title="Request providers in relevant sequence">
 According to the information provided about the lead, BetterContact determines the optimal provider sequence to maximize the enrichment rate.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="2" title="Verify the provided contact data">
  Once a provider returns contact data, we verify it through various layers and only push back valid data to you.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="3" title="Request providers until valid data is found">
  If one provider’s data is invalid, BetterContact will request the following providers until valid data is found.
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

### Enrichable data

BetterContact allows you to enrich different data points of your contacts.

<CardGroup>

<Card title="Direct phone number" icon="phone" href="/api-reference/endpoint/create">
  Get your lead’s verified mobile phone number.
</Card>

<Card
  title="Verified work email"
  icon="envelope"
  href="/api-reference/endpoint/create"
>
   Get your lead’s verified work email address.
</Card>

</CardGroup>

BetterContact also verifies risky and catch_all email to reduce your bounce rate and protect your domain reputation.

### How it works

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="upload" title="Submit your lead(s) to enrich">
    BetterContact’s API has a single endpoint to enrich a single lead or a batch up to 100 contacts at a time. 
    [>See endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/create)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="download" title="Fetch results">
    Waterfall enrichment requires a couple of seconds to request all providers and verify data. Once you have submitted your leads, you have to fetch the enriched data. Alternatively, you can provide a webhook URL in the submit call to instantly get the results without the need to fetch it.
    [>See endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/get)
  </Accordion>
