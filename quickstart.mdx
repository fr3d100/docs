### How does it works ?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Request providers in relevant sequence" icon="1">
    According to the information provided about the lead, BetterContact determines the optimal provider sequence to maximize the enrichment rate.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Verify the provided contact data" icon="2">
    Once a provider returns contact data, we verify it through various layers and only push back valid data to you.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Request providers until valid data is found" icon="3">
    If one provider’s data is invalid, BetterContact will request the following providers until valid data is found.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  **<Tooltip tip="">BetterContact also verifies catch_all email</Tooltip>**<Tooltip tip="">.</Tooltip> 

  Meaning  you can now contact unreachable leads without compromising your sending domain reputation.

### How it works

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Submit your lead(s) to enrich" icon="upload">
    BetterContact’s API has a single endpoint to enrich a single lead or a batch up to 100 contacts at a time. [\>See endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/create)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Fetch results" icon="download">
    Waterfall enrichment requires a couple of seconds to request all providers and verify data. Once you have submitted your leads, you have to fetch the enriched data. Alternatively, you can provide a webhook URL in the submit call to instantly get the results without the need to fetch it. [\>See endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/get)
