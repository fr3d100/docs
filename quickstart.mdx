## How the API works

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Submit your lead(s) to enrich" icon="1">
    BetterContact’s API has a single endpoint to enrich a single lead or a batch up to 100 contacts at a time. [\>See endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/create)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Fetch results" icon="2">
    Waterfall enrichment requires a couple of seconds to request all providers and verify data. Once you have submitted your leads, you have to fetch the enriched data. Alternatively, you can provide a webhook URL in the submit call to instantly get the results without the need to fetch it. [\>See endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/get)
  </Accordion>
