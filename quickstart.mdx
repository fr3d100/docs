### Purpose

BetterContact API’s purpose is to serve as the only API you need for your contact data enrichment. No need to create an in-house waterfall enrichment process with several API calls to different providers.

### What BetterContact does?

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Get new leads" icon="address-book" iconType="solid" cta="Discover waterfall Lead Finder">
    Based on Company and People filtering, find the perfect leads matching your creiteria.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Get lead's contacts data" icon="sparkles" iconType="solid" cta="Discover waterfall Enrichment">
    Get direct mobile phone numbers and work email address of your leads to reach and convert them into customers.
  </Card>
</Columns>

### How does it works ? 

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Request providers in relevant sequence" icon="1">
    According to the information provided about the lead, BetterContact determines the optimal provider sequence to maximize the enrichment rate.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Verify the provided contact data" icon="2">
    Once a provider returns contact data, we verify it through various layers and only push back valid data to you.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Request providers until valid data is found" icon="3">
    If one provider’s data is invalid, BetterContact will request the following providers until valid data is found.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Enrichable data

BetterContact allows you to enrich different data points of your contacts.

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Direct phone number" icon="phone" href="/api-reference/endpoint/create">
    Get your lead’s verified mobile phone number.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Verified work email" icon="envelope" href="/api-reference/endpoint/create">
    Get your lead’s verified work email address.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

BetterContact also verifies risky and catch_all email to reduce your bounce rate and protect your domain reputation.

### How it works

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Submit your lead(s) to enrich" icon="upload">
    BetterContact’s API has a single endpoint to enrich a single lead or a batch up to 100 contacts at a time. [\>See endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/create)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Fetch results" icon="download">
    Waterfall enrichment requires a couple of seconds to request all providers and verify data. Once you have submitted your leads, you have to fetch the enriched data. Alternatively, you can provide a webhook URL in the submit call to instantly get the results without the need to fetch it. [\>See endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/get)
